This program generates a random (usually non-readable, meaningless) text for ***n*** number of paragraphs where ***n*** is taken as the user's input. It is capped to generate 100 paragraphs at random, which in return, increase the performance significantly.

## 📌 About

This program executes Browser Python [(Brython)](https://brython.info/). Wait, what? What do you mean by “Browser Python”? <br />
It means that the Random Text is generated with a simple Python script (also using random module to ensure fresh, distinguished and unidentical result on every load), and the generated content is loaded on webpage using Brython.

🔧 Usage
=========

### Requirements - Python 3.X is installed

Open the Command Line/Command Prompt and enter

```python
python -m http.server [port]
``` 
where using a custom port number is optional, as port number defaults to 8000 with `http.server`. More about it can be [found here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html).

▶ For Python 2, [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) can be used instead.
