This program generates a random (usually non-readable, meaningless) text for ***n*** number of paragraphs where ***n*** is taken as the user's input. It is capped to generate 1-100 random paragraphs, to keep the performance significant.

## About 

This program executes Browser Python [(Brython)](https://brython.info/). Wait, what? What is meant by ‚ÄúBrowser Python‚Äù? <br />
It means that the Random Text is generated with a simple Python script (also using random module to ensure fresh, distinguished and unidentical result on every load), and the generated content is loaded on webpage using Brython.

## Usage 

#### Requirement - [Python 3x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) should be installed, for running localhost

The code can be run through localhost. Assuming that Python (Python v3, specifically) is already configured on your system, one simple way to setup a localhost would be by using the Command Line/Command Prompt in the same directory, and entering:

```
python -m http.server [port]
``` 

where using a custom port number is optional, as port number defaults to 8000 with `http.server`. More about it can be [found here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html).

‚ñ∂ For Python 2 supported terminals, [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) can be used instead.

_Note_: To launch the code in local machine, [index.html](./index.html) file cannot be directly opened, as the brython file may not get executed successfully while opening the index file from the repository source folder (with "IOError: can't load external script ... (AJAX calls not supported with protocol file:///" ). So, localhost server setup is preferred.
